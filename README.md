# Telecom-churn-prediction-with-PySpark
### Overview
Telecom churn prediction is a critical task in the telecommunications industry. By identifying customers who are likely to churn (i.e., switch to a competitor), telecom companies can take proactive measures to retain those customers and minimize revenue loss. In this project, I used PySpark and machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate churn prediction models. Data used in the projects are downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets?datasetId=255093&sortBy=voteCount).
